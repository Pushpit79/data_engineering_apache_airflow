1. We define a function called query_films that accepts keyword arguments (**kwargs). Each keyword argument represents a column in the dataset, and the corresponding value or range of values to filter by.

2. Inside the function, we iterate through the keyword arguments and apply filters to the DataFrame based on the provided column-value pairs.

3. We handle different types of values:

    > For lists, we use the isin method to filter by multiple specific values (e.g., genres).
    > For tuples representing ranges, we use boolean indexing to filter by a range of values (e.g., release years).
    > For single values, we use equality comparisons to filter by a specific value.

4. We provide example test cases to demonstrate the functionality:

    > Query films directed by Quentin Tarantino released between 1979 and 2000.
    > Query films directed by George Lucas released after 1990.
    > Query films with genres "Action" or "Adventure".
5. We display the results of each query for verification.

This approach allows users to flexibly query the dataset based on any combination of columns and values, providing a reusable and flexible backend for querying functionality.
